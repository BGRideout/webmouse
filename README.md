# Web Mouse

The Web Mouse provides a way to use your mobile phone or tablet as a remote mouse and keyboard for a computer.  This is useful for an arrangement such as a computer connected to a TV by an HDMI cable for streaming video and you want to control the computer while seated across the room.

The mouse is accessed as a web page through a browser on the phone or tablet using the URL http://webmouse.local.

This project requires the picolibs repository to be installed in a parallel directory.

Hardware is either a pico-w or pico2-w with a pushbutton wired between GPIO 16 and ground. Pushing the button starts the WiFi access point mode for setup purposes.
